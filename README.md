# To-Do List SignedInApp
This React app was developed for CSCI124 at Harvey Mudd. It allows the user to create, edit, delete, and toggle the completion status of custom tasks. Currently, no data is stored so refreshing the page clears all information. Information about the design process is available in the docs folder. This project can be run locally by cloning the repositiory and running ```npm install``` then ```npm start```. It's also deployed live at [this link](https://mbernhard7.github.io/cs124/).
